    <h2>Nikola's Life</h2>
    <p>Nikola Tesla is Crotian-born scientist, known by many as the “true father of electricity” opposed to other famous scientist/engineer Thomas Edison. Tesla is known most for his development of the alternating-current (AC) system of electricity; however, he had made many innovations between the 19th and 20th century, solidifying his place of one of the greatest minds in modern history. Tesla first came to the United States in 1884, and began working beside who would be known as his opponent, Thomas Eddison. The two had a very successful beginning in their careers until dividing personalities drove them apart.</p>
    <p>After struggling for 2 years as a manual laborer, Tesla received funding for the Tesla Electric Company. He was now given the resources to truly develop the AC electrical system and pioneering breakthroughs in technology such as remote control, x-rays, induction motors, the radio, and most famously, the tesla coil. The AC electrical system has since been the world-wide standard since the 20th century, and improvements are still being made currently.

    <p>However, Tesla’s success didn’t last forever, of the adrenaline of his prior success, in 1900, Tesla set out to create a worldwide wireless communication system. Despite his enthusiasm, after being overshadowed by the rapid success of his competitors, Tesla was soon forced to abandon his project. By 1915, his project site had been foreclosed, and two years later, Tesla himself filed for bankruptcy. As time went on, Tesla’s ideas only got more and more outlandish, to a point of planning a massive death ray, that during WWII sparked the interest of the Soviet Union. The failure of his free energy project had sent Tesla into a nervous breakdown that he had never recovered from, in 1943, at the age of 86, Tesla had passed away from coronary thrombosis, poor and alone.</p>
